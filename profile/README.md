## What is Quark?
Quark is an open-source relational database management system designed
for applications, backend, and for everyday usage â€” Quark brings database
management tools for both developers and non-developers easing database
tasks:

- **Simple, intuitive querying language**: Quark delivers a querying language with
Python-like syntax called Quark QL offering tons of instructions for selection,
deletion, transformation, and editing.
- **User-friendly table editor**: Quark makes data viewing and editing painless
via Quark Studio. You don't need any programming experience and experience in
writing queries.
- **Robust APIs for all popular programming languages**: Adopt Quark in your next
project by including Quark API. At this moment we support API for Java, C#, PHP,
Node.js, and Python.
- **Data validation inside table columns**: Quark frees you from writing validation
code on top your queries. Just add column modifiers to make Quark throw error
if inserting value doesn't match your rules.
